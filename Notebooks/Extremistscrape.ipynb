Legion is best expansion, @ChubsVevo agrees love y'all\n","1442570413620477956 2021-09-27 19:22:42 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> I love this game, it has a special place in my heart, but the way the game is being treated is just so stupid. The recent Blizzard stuff does not help either, but I intentionally left that out cause this thread was about WoW.   Just wanted to talk a bit about it.\n","1442570411519139848 2021-09-27 19:22:42 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> Furthermore, it's also annoying how they do not expand on previously successful systems or game-aspects. The order halls were great and gave class identity, the legendary power in late Legion was good as well, but no they just repeat this cycle.  https://t.co/2x1oZdVjvp\n","1442570407538745347 2021-09-27 19:22:41 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> They have missed the note a lot this expansion on the systems, although the PvP aspect has been okay with them adding PvP vendors. The legendary system is whatever, does not feel as satisfying as in Legion.\n","1442570405714153473 2021-09-27 19:22:41 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> The gameplay systems are godawful this time around. The WQs take godawful long, the mostly forced grind for anima for things, them making their rogue-like mode, Thorgast, actually unfun at first and trying to balance a goddamn rogue-like despite it being PvE.\n","1442570403256229892 2021-09-27 19:22:40 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> Also forgetting plotlines such as the arbiter, literally nothing regarding her for 2 patches despite her being the most important being in the Shadowlands. On storytelling I can go on a long time but that will make this thread a book and I don't want that. Storytelling is trash.\n","1442570401494847489 2021-09-27 19:22:40 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> Meanwhile, we still are fighting Horde vs Alliance every time without any purpose to either side. At this point, it is better to remove the faction wars cause every single expansion we end up working together; N'zoth, the Jailer etc etc.\n","1442570399561109505 2021-09-27 19:22:39 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> Storytelling has been so godawful with Sylvanas and the Horde. Nothing but favouritism for the character, shafting the character along with others. The Jailer is the most one-dimensional villain ever who is trying to get all the infinity sigils to conquer azeroth or something.\n","1442570397761814530 2021-09-27 19:22:39 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> It was absolutely a failure on Blizzard's department on how long it has taken. People were still in Corona, you'd maybe think you would make more content for the game asap so you can get the most out of the time that people are home, but no, an agonizing 213 days of the same.\n","1442570396000194561 2021-09-27 19:22:38 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> Now, Shadowlands has so far been a failure, though. A main reason is how long it has taken to get to a new major patch, that being 9.1. It has taken a whole 213 days to get out a new patch, 5 more days than Vanilla and the first patch had in between time.\n","1442570388685402113 2021-09-27 19:22:36 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> Right now, we are in the Shadowlands, an expansion with some gorgeous zones and artistic direction. Patch 9.0 was a really good patch overall, had a great raid, the storytelling was very iffy, but I enjoyed Denathrius a ton.  https://t.co/elCRzYEPNL\n","1442570384432271364 2021-09-27 19:22:35 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> BFA was a trainwreck of an expansion, lack of story, lack of actual fun gameplay mechanics, really annoying levelling and power grind etc. It was an all around clown fiesta and still I stuck with it cause it is one of my favourite games.\n","1442570382309920768 2021-09-27 19:22:35 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> when Legion rolled around with all the mythic plus and such. I've invested a ton of time into this game and I've loved every second of Legion aside from the slow levelling early on in the expansion. It was my favourite expansion and was nice to have after WoD.\n","1442570380057747459 2021-09-27 19:22:34 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> Alright, long ass thread is incoming regarding WoW. It is just some thoughts I will share with you guys with the game I love but just cannot get myself to play.  I played this game for a bit, though not from the start, but since MoP I did play the game and started getting into it\n","1442551553534173198 2021-09-27 18:07:46 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> @MadderRed1 @PinkMilkPlaguey :((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((\n","1442550757652406273 2021-09-27 18:04:36 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> @MadderRed1 @PinkMilkPlaguey we truly built the same  https://t.co/WPTb1j754I\n","1442550560855625730 2021-09-27 18:03:49 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> @PinkMilkPlaguey 839\n","1442532431639334914 2021-09-27 16:51:47 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> I have chosen #GromitMug what will your choice be?\n","1442516148809916416 2021-09-27 15:47:05 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> @KarlaYuria Yeah, willing to trade it for 20$\n","1442515994514272258 2021-09-27 15:46:28 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> @milkobeni Based girl\n","1442515858660605964 2021-09-27 15:45:56 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> @bugesoteric @milkobeni @OhasiArt Teruteru only got French cause of his shitty hairstyle  Also French Junko bruh\n","1442515253879787520 2021-09-27 15:43:31 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> Can't wait for the Netherlands being a weed girl with cheese by her side, wearing a sleezy outfit cause that's accurate.\n","1442514533289893894 2021-09-27 15:40:40 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> @Fantastic_Grim_ @0wlGhost @ROTTENFEMUR What the hell is the appeal of it cuz I cannot see it\n","1442496399380148227 2021-09-27 14:28:36 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> Holy mother of God yes please dm me as well\n","1442495995309297672 2021-09-27 14:27:00 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> @PaTaPoN1337 Doing fine  You?\n","1442495693680226309 2021-09-27 14:25:48 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> @TacoSlayer69 @maynardmilf Youre the one proposing it in the first place\n","1442492975288750080 2021-09-27 14:15:00 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> @pepe_crusader I love iiiiit\n","1442492327801524224 2021-09-27 14:12:25 +0000 <BottleOfScrumpe> @pepe_crusader AAAAH ITS SO CUTE!
