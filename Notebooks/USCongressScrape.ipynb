It very much is the Wild West of finance. They make new things possible, which isn’t always a good thing. They can have consequences no one expected. This field deserves a great deal of attention going forward.\n","1398003857473556484 2021-05-27 19:51:07 +0000 <SenatorRounds> So how does this relate to Colonial Pipeline? Bitcoins only exist as data. They can be tied to digital wallets rather than a specific person’s identity, which means people believe they can receive and spend them anonymously- perfect for secret transactions like ransoms.\n","1398003856076939272 2021-05-27 19:51:07 +0000 <SenatorRounds> This means that, as bitcoin gets more valuable, more people mine, mining gets harder, it takes more computations and more electricity to mine a bitcoin. Some of you may be familiar with @elonmusk recent statement about bitcoin’s carbon footprint.\n","1398003854676008964 2021-05-27 19:51:07 +0000 <SenatorRounds> In short, the more miners there are, the harder it is to mine bitcoins. Since the best way to mine is to simply use more computations, there is an incentive to pool as much effort into mining as possible, simply to make sure your pool has an advantage over other miners.\n","1398003853312811008 2021-05-27 19:51:06 +0000 <SenatorRounds> The interesting thing is that you can make it easier or harder to form new blocks if you make the nonce higher or lower. And for bitcoin, the difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks so that the rate of formation of new blocks is constant.\n","1398003851882545154 2021-05-27 19:51:06 +0000 <SenatorRounds> Despite the randomness, it's more like they’re getting paid a fee to maintain ledgers than mining or creating bitcoins. Miners provide proof that they’ve done work to contribute to the chain in exchange for compensation (in bitcoins), rather than making bitcoins themselves.\n","1398003850464960516 2021-05-27 19:51:06 +0000 <SenatorRounds> The first person to win a block gets a prize of bitcoins. Since the second step in forming a block is essentially up to chance, the most effective way to mine is simply to throw more computation at the problem, verifying as many blocks as possible as fast as possible.\n","1398003848980144128 2021-05-27 19:51:05 +0000 <SenatorRounds> You may ask “why not just guess 000…0001 for your hash, if the goal is to get a hash below the target nonce?” The answer: your guess is put through what is basically a randomizing equation based on several inputs, like the timestamp. Guessing your hash ahead of time is #noncense\n","1398003846924976133 2021-05-27 19:51:05 +0000 <SenatorRounds> In short, mining a new bitcoin is a two-step process. First, you need to verify a block’s worth of transactions, then you need to guess a hash (a number). Your guess is compared to a target (called a nonce) and if your guess is below the nonce then you form a block.\n","1398003845532356614 2021-05-27 19:51:05 +0000 <SenatorRounds> Since #bitcoins are decentralized, there isn’t a government or bank to maintain the system, which means there needs to be a different way. People who verify transactions are bitcoin miners, and the process of verification is fundamental to how they make (or mine) new bitcoins.\n","1398003844181803009 2021-05-27 19:51:04 +0000 <SenatorRounds> These protocols revolve around cryptography (for computers, this is the use of math to code information) hence “crypto”currencies. However, someone needs to actually verify each new block in the chain to keep the system running smoothly.\n","1398003842793545728 2021-05-27 19:51:04 +0000 <SenatorRounds> This blockchain of transactions forms a distributed ledger that is difficult to modify and easy to verify (in theory); a ledger that is maintained collectively on a network with specific protocols to verify each new block in the chain, meaning that bitcoin exchanges are secure.\n","1398003841434636297 2021-05-27 19:51:04 +0000 <SenatorRounds> Using bitcoin as an example: bitcoins exist in digital ledgers, but to prevent fraudulent exchanges, transactions are recorded in encrypted blocks. Each block points at the previous block and has a timestamp. Go where each block points and you get a chain, called a “blockchain”.\n","1398003840042078212 2021-05-27 19:51:03 +0000 <SenatorRounds> The software used to make new CCs exists and is publicly available, which means that developing a new CC can be done in as little as a few hours. Honestly, it looks like a return to the days when each bank printed their own notes.\n","1398003838678974474 2021-05-27 19:51:03 +0000 <SenatorRounds> CCs exist only in digital ledgers and wallets rather than as physical objects like dollar bills. Like all fiat currencies, they have value only because people agree they do, but CCs in general lack the backing of a government or central bank.\n","1398003837240287232 2021-05-27 19:51:03 +0000 <SenatorRounds> Some people decided that, if the commodity backing a currency doesn’t matter, then why should money need to be a physical object and why should you need a government (or bank) to back money? From there, some programmers started developing cryptocurrencies (CCs).\n","1398003835864498183 2021-05-27 19:51:02 +0000 <SenatorRounds> Some history: in the last century governments have moved away from commodity currencies (such as gold) to fiat currencies (such as Federal Reserve notes) cementing the idea that money can have value just because people agree it does.\n","1398003834069336066 2021-05-27 19:51:02 +0000 <SenatorRounds> Software developments, however, mean that they don’t need to bother with masks and voice modulators. They can issue a ransom and request payment with a cryptocurrency (CC) (like bitcoin) rather than exchange a briefcase full of cash.\n","1398003832622358532 2021-05-27 19:51:02 +0000 <SenatorRounds> Hostage and ransom payments are a practice that has been applied in different contexts for thousands of years, ranging from prisoner exchanges to kidnappings. Today, a person collecting a ransom payment does not want their identity publicly tied to a ransom.\n","1398003831087190021 2021-05-27 19:51:01 +0000 <SenatorRounds> Thread: Recently, I tweeted about the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack.

But they can't be bothered to provide fair wages and safe working conditions? I don’t think so. I stand with the workers on strike in Topeka. It takes enormous courage to stand up and fight back, and I applaud you.\n","1415773995165622273 2021-07-15 20:43:18 +0000 <SenSanders> As Senate Budget Committee Chairman, I want to give you an update on what's in the budget bill we're working on and why it is the most consequential legislation considered by Congress since the 1930s.    https://t.co/lrQN1C6SIb\n","1415727745343148039 2021-07-15 17:39:32 +0000 <SenSanders> TODAY working families will start receiving direct monthly payments of up to $300 per child as part of the historic expansion of the Child Tax Credit. It is a huge step towards cutting childhood poverty in half and will bring relief to parents and caregivers across the country.\n","1415644563591532545 2021-07-15 12:09:00 +0000 <SenSanders> Finally, it is my hope that this legislation will restore the American people’s faith in their government by proving that it works for them, not just the wealthy and powerful and their lobbyists.\n","1415644562975039489 2021-07-15 12:08:59 +0000 <SenSanders> It will take on the existential threat of climate change by creating millions of good-paying jobs transforming our energy systems away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy.\n","1415644562408751108 2021-07-15 12:08:59 +0000 <SenSanders> It will ensure our seniors can live in dignity by expanding Medicare to cover eyeglasses, hearing aids, and dental care.\n","1415644561758736384 2021-07-15 12:08:59 +0000 <SenSanders> It will take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and the reality that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs by having Medicare negotiate prescription drug prices with drug companies.\n","1415644561142124547 2021-07-15 12:08:59 +0000 <SenSanders> It will make higher education affordable by allowing everyone to attend community college tuition-free.\n","1415644560496136193 2021-07-15 12:08:59 +0000 <SenSanders> It will guarantee that no family pays over 7 percent of their income for child care. It will, finally, provide paid family and medical leave for working people.\n","1415644559896453124 2021-07-15 12:08:59 +0000 <SenSanders> This legislation will aggressively reduce childhood poverty by extending the Child Tax Credit to deliver direct monthly payments of up to $300 per child to working families.\n","1415644559137288193 2021-07-15 12:08:58 +0000 <SenSanders> In many ways, it is the most consequential piece of legislation for working families since the Great Depression.\n","1415644558482939905 2021-07-15 12:08:58 +0000 <SenSanders> At a time of massive wealth and income inequality and when half our people are living paycheck to paycheck, what this reconciliation bill will finally do is address the needs of our working families by asking the wealthy and large corporations to pay their fair share of taxes.\n","1415399866105217024 2021-07-14 19:56:39 +0000 <SenSanders> If we do not act on climate change now, our grandchildren are going to look us in the eyes 30 years from now and say, “What did you do? Didn’t you know? How did you let this happen?” We must lead the world in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels.  https://t.co/JzBy6wBfTe\n","1415049048940220418 2021-07-13 20:42:38 +0000 <SenSanders> Do not tell me that addressing the existential threat of climate change is radical. Failing to save the planet from climate disasters is radical.\n","1414983421043032065 2021-07-13 16:21:51 +0000 <SenSanders> What we are trying to do, right now, is transformative.  https://t.co/4YH15GQxtQ\n","1414785066455158786 2021-07-13 03:13:39 +0000 <SenSanders> All people have the right to protest and to live in a democratic society. I call on the Cuban government to respect opposition rights and refrain from violence. It’s also long past time to end the unilateral U.S. embargo on Cuba, which has only hurt, not helped, the Cuban people.\n","1414678305576570882 2021-07-12 20:09:26 +0000 <SenSanders> Learn more here:  https://t.co/K3e3P6tOdA\n","1414678218393653256 2021-07-12 20:09:05 +0000 <SenSanders> For many families, no action is needed to receive payments. But make sure to file your 2020 taxes as soon as possible to ensure you receive what you're owed. If you don’t normally file a tax return, you can register to receive your payments using the IRS Non-filer Sign-up tool.\n","1414678136420192256 2021-07-12 20:08:45 +0000 <SenSanders> But let me be clear. The American Rescue Plan was emergency legislation. We must now either make the expansion permanent or, at least, extend it for a number of years. And that’s exactly what I’m fighting to do now.\n","1414678019185201159 2021-07-12 20:08:17 +0000 <SenSanders> There is no question that this historic increase in the child tax credit is going to make a real difference in people’s lives. It’s a major reason the ARP is one of the most significant pieces of legislation passed for working people in the modern history of this country.\n","1414677947265527808 2021-07-12 20:08:00 +0000 <SenSanders> A single mother making $25,000 with a 2-year-old will receive a total of $3,600, including 6 monthly payments of $300 and an additional $1,800 as part of her 2021 tax return.\n","1414677839589302283 2021-07-12 20:07:35 +0000 <SenSanders> For example, the average married couple making $75,000 with two children, a 3-yr-old and an 8-yr-old, will receive a total of $6,600 in the child tax credit, including 6 monthly payments of $550 and an additional $3,300 as part of their 2021 tax return.\n","1414677758106607620 2021-07-12 20:07:15 +0000 <SenSanders> Married couples making under $150,000 &amp; single parents making less than $112,500 will receive a monthly payment of $300 per child under 6 and $250 per child between ages 6 and 17 for the next 6 months, with the rest of the benefit to be received as part of next year’s tax return.\n","1414677667463454725 2021-07-12 20:06:54 +0000 <SenSanders> That includes a historic expansion of the Child Tax Credit.

Ocean fires in the Gulf of Mexico. Subway waterfalls in New York City. A heat dome in the Northwest melting power cables, killing hundreds and frying marine animals. I have been told that combatting climate change is expensive. Compared to what?\n","1413218142122385414 2021-07-08 19:27:16 +0000 <SenSanders> Since 2016, 14 top pharmaceutical companies spent $577 billion on stock buybacks and dividends – $56 billion more than research and development. We must lower the outrageous price of prescription drugs in budget reconciliation and use the savings to expand Medicare with 51 votes.\n","1412791144950517763 2021-07-07 15:10:32 +0000 <SenSanders> You will forgive me for not having a lot of patience when some of my colleagues in the Senate tell me that we can’t afford to act on climate change. Really? The question that we must be asking, as loudly as possible, is how we can afford not to act?\n","1411857650959196161 2021-07-05 01:21:09 +0000 <SenSanders> On this Fourth of July, let us recommit to building a future that works for all of us, not just the few.\n","1411778438986412040 2021-07-04 20:06:24 +0000 <SenSanders> 89% of Democrats &amp; 79% of Republicans support expanding Medicare to include dental, hearing &amp; vision care.  86% of Democrats &amp; 70% of Republicans support providing seniors with home health care.  This is what real bipartisanship looks like, even if all Republicans in DC vote no.\n","1411372314491510787 2021-07-03 17:12:36 +0000 <SenSanders> During the 1930s, as part of FDR's New Deal we electrified the nation. In the 1960s, we sent a man to the moon as part of JFK's space program. Today, we must combat climate change and lead the world away from fossil fuels. We cannot fail. The future of the planet is at stake.\n","1410931263108784132 2021-07-02 12:00:01 +0000 <SenSanders> Millions of Americans cannot see well enough to walk across their living room, can’t hear well enough to engage in a conversation, or can’t chew food properly because their teeth are in such bad shape due to the cost of basic care.

Democrats can and should abolish the filibuster to save democracy and make it easier, not harder, for people to vote.\n","1410629275640795137 2021-07-01 16:00:02 +0000 <SenSanders> Why is it that in the richest country in the history of the world we leave our seniors to suffer?

Yes. We have to act BOLDLY to address climate change.\n","1409243030608089099 2021-06-27 20:11:35 +0000 <SenSanders> Let me be clear: There will not be a bipartisan infrastructure deal without a reconciliation bill that substantially improves the lives of working families and combats the existential threat of climate change. No reconciliation bill, no deal. We need transformative change NOW.\n","1409162655990943747 2021-06-27 14:52:12 +0000 <SenSanders> Jane and I are saddened by the passing of Sen. Mike Gravel.

Stay safe, and know that we're all cheering you on back home.\n","1418338165190905856 2021-07-22 22:32:24 +0000 <timkaine> The Senate Armed Services Committee has passed our annual defense bill—and in addition to delivering much-needed support to Virginia’s defense community, I'm so glad that this year’s NDAA includes landmark reforms to address the scourge of sexual assault in our military ranks.\n","1417242603100286977 2021-07-19 21:59:02 +0000 <timkaine> Thanks to coordinated efforts from Congress, @POTUS, @StateDept, and @DeptofDefense, Afghans who risked their lives to support our military and foreign policy objectives can escape the dangers they face due to their service. I applaud this step to protect our Afghan allies.\n","1416758358875459585 2021-07-18 13:54:49 +0000 <timkaine> Baseball games, movie theaters, schools, churches. This is normal in America—but it doesn’t have to be. We can and must do more to keep our communities safe. That starts with passing federal legislation to reduce gun violence.\n","1416204704632168454 2021-07-17 01:14:48 +0000 <timkaine> We have got to secure a path to citizenship for Dreamers—period. These young people deserve to live out of the shadows in the country they have called home since childhood.\n","1415643050018230272 2021-07-15 12:02:59 +0000 <timkaine> Today, millions of American families will see more money directly in their bank accounts—thanks to the expanded Child Tax Credit. 1.6M kids in VA will benefit. 85K Virginian kids will be lifted out of poverty. Grateful Dems in Congress and @POTUS were able to make this happen.\n","1415401666225098756 2021-07-14 20:03:48 +0000 <timkaine> The budget agreement we have announced is a historic investment in America's economy and families. From bringing down the cost of childcare and health care to expanding early childhood education to fighting climate change, this is transformative.\n","1415072486694264841 2021-07-13 22:15:46 +0000 <timkaine> A superb pick by President Biden. Jeff Flake is a principled public servant who has deep respect for the intergral role of the Senate in matters of war, peace, and diplomacy.  https://t.co/ro4AeNP4qW\n","1415027303558651910 2021-07-13 19:16:13 +0000 <timkaine> I commend these lawmakers for taking a bold stand for voting rights, which are at the heart of our democracy. I'm with them in this fight, and will continue to work toward a solution to protect the right to vote at the federal level.\n","1414923098600755207 2021-07-13 12:22:09 +0000 <timkaine> Go Virginia!  https://t.co/4YJlEQFAlI\n","1414622159188774913 2021-07-12 16:26:19 +0000 <timkaine> I'm alarmed by Cuban President Diaz-Canel’s call for confrontation against peaceful protesters. I stand with the Cuban people exercising their right to demand freedom and reform and speaking out against decades of oppression. All should be able to voice their opinions peacefully.\n","1413887308076617740 2021-07-10 15:46:17 +0000 <timkaine> Just wrapped a bipartisan Congressional delegation to Mexico, Ecuador, Colombia, and Guatemala. We met with government, civil society, and business leaders to discuss fighting COVID, promoting trade, and addressing the drivers of migration. Grateful for these strong partnerships.  https://t.co/jz0z2fxvQh\n","1413197012191825923 2021-07-08 18:03:18 +0000 <timkaine> Glad to see the Biden-Harris Administration and our Democratic Party pushing to protect voting rights. I am committed to doing everything in my power to support the right to vote and pass comprehensive voting rights legislation. This couldn't be any more important.\n","1412491739810697221 2021-07-06 19:20:48 +0000 <timkaine> We’ve got to expand student debt relief.

Hopeful the @usedgov will consider our recommendations.\n","1411758681331585025 2021-07-04 18:47:53 +0000 <timkaine> A good #4thofJuly read.  https://t.co/ptP9H5eodf\n","1411744481553039360 2021-07-04 17:51:28 +0000 <timkaine> Happy Independence Day! After a tough year, what a joy to be able to celebrate our country’s 245th birthday knowing that we are on the path to recovery. I hope everyone enjoys a safe and happy 4th of July with family and friends.\n","1410993045957496834 2021-07-02 16:05:31 +0000 <timkaine> As we approach Independence Day—a holiday celebrating this country’s optimistic founding and democratic ideals—I am reminded even more of the urgency of protecting the right to vote and preserving the building blocks of our democracy. We cannot give up on this existential issue.\n","1410634782195736579 2021-07-01 16:21:55 +0000 <timkaine> Glad to join @GovernorVA and @SecDebHaaland today in Hampton Roads as the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project takes a big step forward with federal support. VA’s growing offshore wind industry will protect the environment, create jobs, and strengthen our clean energy economy!  https://t.co/KVNuB5LG1Z\n","1410620155000938499 2021-07-01 15:23:47 +0000 <timkaine> Today’s decision demonstrates that the Supreme Court can no longer be counted upon to preserve the right fundamental to all other rights. Congress must pass comprehensive voting rights legislation—now.\n","1409965738673180674 2021-06-29 20:03:22 +0000 <timkaine> Proud and grateful that Virginia is securing the right to vote. But too many states are going in the opposite direction—so we MUST protect voting rights at the federal level. This is of existential importance, and we need to get it done.  https://t.co/ahvMMJtdnK\n","1408205837869387779 2021-06-24 23:30:09 +0000 <timkaine> Glad the Biden-Harris Administration is taking action to relocate Afghans who have supported our troops—as we begin to withdraw from Afghanistan, it's so important to do right by these brave allies.\n","1408157089952903174 2021-06-24 20:16:27 +0000 <timkaine> Exciting day for me as a longtime music lover: My first co-songwriting credit, in honor of my friend Roger Brown's retirement from 17 years as @BerkleeCollege President, is out today! Hope you'll check it out in honor of Roger—and the joy music can bring.  https://t.co/7TEUBUZJu1\n","1407756581836673024 2021-06-23 17:44:58 +0000 <timkaine> And so, surrounded by his friends and family, I address John Warner as he used to address me—“Well old friend, today you are at home.”\n","1407756580246867972 2021-06-23 17:44:58 +0000 <timkaine> But today I celebrate John's impact over a three decade tenure in the Senate. The family he created from Senate colleagues—not just Senators, but committee staff, Capitol Police, food service workers, Senate gym employees. The ever-present curiosity and twinkle in the eye he had.\n","1407756578137255937 2021-06-23 17:44:57 +0000 <timkaine> John Warner saw the Capitol under attack on January 6. He was deeply saddened by the assault on our democracy. We all should be. Today I am forced to wonder, will we step up to defend our nation as John did?\n","1407756276214419459 2021-06-23 17:43:45 +0000 <timkaine> John joined the Navy as soon as he graduated from high school during World War II, and then rejoined the Marine Corps when the U.S. entered the Korean War. He did this at risk to his life, health, and career. But of course he prioritized defending the nation above all else.\n","1407756275484696585 2021-06-23 17:43:45 +0000 <timkaine> As I entered public life, what impressed me most about John was his obvious belief that country and character count above all else. He was a Republican and I am a Democrat—but that never mattered. He never hesitated to prioritize his country over the orthodoxy of the day.\n","1407756274289233925 2021-06-23 17:43:45 +0000 <timkaine> Long before I knew John Warner the patriotic public servant, I was honored to consider John a friend. It was only upon coming to the Senate—four years after he retired—that I came to fully understand the mark he left on the Senate, his beloved Commonwealth, and his country.\n","1407756272745787397 2021-06-23 17:43:44 +0000 <timkaine> Today I was deeply honored to be able to share some of my thoughts at my dear friend John Warner's funeral—and I'd like to share some of them here as well, in memory of a man who truly exemplified love of country and character:\n","1407708631727026183 2021-06-23 14:34:26 +0000 <timkaine> There must be a thorough review of all Tier 1 Group contracts and stronger State Department oversight of U.S. defense services provided to foreign nations—especially ones with problematic human rights records like Saudi Arabia, to ensure something like this never happens again.\n","1407708630745600004 2021-06-23 14:34:26 +0000 <timkaine> These reports confirm what I feared to be true when I pressed Trump’s DOD nominee and Tier 1 board member Louis Bremer on this disturbing subject last year: Saudi nationals responsible for assassinating Mr. Khashoggi were trained by Tier 1 Group, a U.S. private security company.\n","1407467933421522945 2021-06-22 22:37:59 +0000 <timkaine> So what's next? We have to pass voting rights. I'm going to do everything I can, and we might need to get creative—but we are not accepting failure on this existential issue. The burden is on Democrats' shoulders now, and we're going to move forward and find solutions.\n","1407467560153518082 2021-06-22 22:36:30 +0000 <timkaine> Republicans have filibustered the January 6th commission. Equal pay. Now voting rights. On ALL these policies that matter to the American people, they are determined to block us. But we're the majority—and we need to act like it.\n","1407465280595501057 2021-06-22 22:27:26 +0000 <timkaine> If Republicans won’t protect our democracy—after an attack on the Capitol, after state legislatures blatantly try to take voting rights away from Americans—Democrats have to. Period.\n","1407405488883503107 2021-06-22 18:29:51 +0000 <timkaine> Incredible progress for the American people. Thankful for a President who believes in science and an Administration dedicated to helping us recover from this pandemic!

Vindman!\n","1407054532597665796 2021-06-21 19:15:17 +0000 <timkaine> The Child Tax Credit is a hugely meaningful part of the American Rescue Plan—one that will lift millions of children out of poverty, including 85,000 kids in Virginia. Most families will get automatic payments—no sign ups needed—but check out this thread for more information:\n","1406768143456952329 2021-06-21 00:17:16 +0000 <timkaine> Jammed with Tommy and Chip last night on “There Stands the Glass” and “Bad News.” #CowboysInTheCampfire coming soon to a backyard near you!\n","1406238495572729858 2021-06-19 13:12:38 +0000 <timkaine> 156 years ago, America took a monumental step toward becoming a more perfect union. As we celebrate the joyful day of #Juneteenth let's also draw inspiration for continuing the march ahead.  Let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap—if we do not give up!\n","1405563876733751300 2021-06-17 16:31:56 +0000 <timkaine> The 18-year-old Iraq War authorization is obsolete. The Government of Iraq is now a partner—not an enemy—so the House’s vote to repeal it is both welcome and overdue. Time for the Senate to follow suit and put the 2002 AUMF to rest before a future president wreaks havoc with it.\n","1405544042205753344 2021-06-17 15:13:08 +0000 <timkaine> 6 years ago, a white supremacist shooter killed 9 people gathered in prayer in Charleston. There is deep heartache in such violence being committed in a place of worship. We pray for their memories and loved ones—and we continue to push for action to prevent senseless tragedies.\n","1405532138330464272 2021-06-17 14:25:49 +0000 <timkaine> Good news. Now can we finally focus on making the ACA better instead of fighting off GOP efforts to strip health care from millions?  https://t.co/HNIZLhzcDd\n","1405338681259532288 2021-06-17 01:37:06 +0000 <timkaine> We have an immense and existential burden to protect our democracy and people’s ability to participate. I care deeply about this as a civil rights attorney, a Senator, and an American, and I am not willing to accept failure as a possibility.\n","1405338680227680259 2021-06-17 01:37:05 +0000 <timkaine> It is my hope that we will get a comprehensive voting rights bill—with all 50 Democrats on board—on the Senate floor for a vote in the coming weeks.\n","1405338679074344963 2021-06-17 01:37:05 +0000 <timkaine> While states like Virginia are making incredible progress on protecting voting rights, Congress has a significant role to play—as we did in the 1960s with the VRA—in stopping states from interfering with people’s ability to choose their leaders.\n","1405338677828587527 2021-06-17 01:37:05 +0000 <timkaine> It is absolutely imperative—and made even more dramatically so by the attack on our democracy on January 6—that we protect the voting rights of the American people. My thoughts right now:\n","1405189775456362510 2021-06-16 15:45:24 +0000 <timkaine> Key takeaway from today's Biden-Putin summit—I'm so glad we have a President who doesn’t cozy up to Putin's authoritarianism.  Trump would cozy up to Putin and pour cold water on our allies. Biden is standing strong against Russian misbehavior and linking arms with our allies.\n","1405187989299413004 2021-06-16 15:38:18 +0000 <timkaine> Glad @POTUS is setting the right tone in his Putin meeting. We don't trust Putin and we have to stand strong against Russia’s unacceptable behavior—including human rights abuses. But we also must identify areas of common interest like nuclear diplomacy and preventing terrorism.\n","1405185259487039491 2021-06-16 15:27:27 +0000 <timkaine> Grateful to finally see action on repealing these outdated AUMFs. So much has changed since 1991 and 2002—this movement on our AUMF repeal bill represents a bipartisan recognition of this evolution and a widespread desire to not keep old war authorizations on the books.\n","1404925052986986499 2021-06-15 22:13:29 +0000 <timkaine> Pleased that the Senate has unanimously passed a bill establishing Juneteenth as a national holiday—and glad that hundreds of thousands of federal workers, so many of whom call Virginia home, will be able to mark this meaningful day.\n","1404906012486815744 2021-06-15 20:57:49 +0000 <timkaine> On the 9th anniversary of DACA, I'm committed to working with my Senate colleagues to provide protections for Dreamers and secure their path to citizenship.
