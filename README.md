# CyberProjectPortfolio
Portfolio for CYB6012.2021.AC3.OFFCAMPUS Cyber Project 1

Aim of the project

To build on the existing tools for social medial analysis to identify and predict levels of radicalisation in different movements, making it easier to build data sets and apply analysis on different groups.

Objectives of the project

This project will make it easier to identify radicalisation. This will involve creating a process for collecting data sets from social media sites as well as training a model focusing on one movement that can be using to predict radicalisation in other movements. The core goals of the project are to make data collection more user friendly; create a model optimised for radicalisation identification; and create an interface to allow for repeatable, transparent analysis using different data sets.
