8,USFreedomFront,far-right,@Sparkpoodle1 The difference between capitalism and traditionalism is that under capitalism there is an untouchable elite that has so much wealth that they run the market.

12,USFreedomFront,far-right,@POTUS You say this while inflating the US dollar. Which makes the money in our bank accounts less valuable.

21,USFreedomFront,far-right,@LibertyHangout It’s unbelievable how so many people in the comments think that they are knowledgeable and faithful enough to choose their own canon of scripture and be able to properly interpret it.

38,USFreedomFront,far-right,@GenZ_Rising Legislating morality doesn’t mean that your forcing everyone to pray and go to church.

1010,BottleOfScrumpe,far-right,"Furthermore, it's also annoying how they do not expand on previously successful systems or game-aspects.

1011,BottleOfScrumpe,far-right,"They have missed the note a lot this expansion on the systems, although the PvP aspect has been okay with them adding PvP vendors. The legendary system is whatever, does not feel as satisfying as in Legion.",Scrumpy 🇳🇱 Vampire-Clown manager 🧛‍♀️🤡
1012,BottleOfScrumpe,far-right,"The gameplay systems are godawful this time around.

1014,BottleOfScrumpe,far-right,"Meanwhile, we still are fighting Horde vs Alliance every time without any purpose to either side.

1016,BottleOfScrumpe,far-right,"It was absolutely a failure on Blizzard's department on how long it has taken.

3245,anatoly,moderate,@ScottAdamsSays After drugs are approved they are not technically tracked like in the trial but clinical reports are monitored. Pfizer and Moderna vaccine blind controlled trials are still ongoing (2 years trial length total).,Anatoly Lubarsky
3246,anatoly,moderate,@9rune5 Virus inhaled through the nose generally means higher risk to get severe disease than through the mouth. Therefore my advice is not to mix them 😆,Anatoly Lubarsky
3247,anatoly,moderate,3/3 1. Immune responses waned out especially for elderly who were vaccinated first (December - February) and the booster vaccination has not started yet. 2. Increase in cases due to the outbreak may have stretched hospitals in certain areas.,Anatoly Lubarsky
3248,anatoly,moderate,2/3 The data is COVID deaths vs all closed cases (cases that had outcome) in September 2021  in the US. This way we can evaluate treatment only (and not containment).  Possible explanation:,Anatoly Lubarsky
3249,anatoly,moderate,COVID death rate in the US during September 2021 is 1.92%. This is similar to August (2.04%) but more than double vs the lowest in June (0.89%). We're now officially at pre-vaccine levels. 1/3  https://t.co/jooLGW9YiM,Anatoly Lubarsky
3250,anatoly,moderate,"@9rune5 It is not clear from the experiment what ""survive"" means: would it be still infective after these days? They tested that in small tubes where the water is not diluted.",Anatoly Lubarsky
3251,anatoly,moderate,@ProftranDotCom &gt;&gt;don't we have capacity to know ALL about the spread&lt;&lt; Not really - the virus particle is very tiny. We can't see it even with strong microscope only when isolated in the lab but then we still are not able to fully understand the spread yet.,Anatoly Lubarsky
3252,anatoly,moderate,2/2 The transmission depends strongly on evaporation of microdroplets in ambient air.  https://t.co/JgO6tIilJi,Anatoly Lubarsky

3258,anatoly,moderate,@stoichast @ScottAdamsSays &gt;&gt;humidity reduces spread by causing heavier droplets to form and fall&lt;&lt; Not because of that.,Anatoly Lubarsky

3260,anatoly,moderate,"@geometric_werk @LamaAndEagle @ScottAdamsSays &gt;&gt;Doesn’t higher humidity mean the droplets evaporate slower?&lt;&lt; Yes but it is probably not a major factor.
